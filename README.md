# Predicting-Customer-Churn
Customer churn is when a companyâ€™s customers stop doing business with that company. Businesses are very keen on measuring churn because keeping an existing customer is far less expensive than acquiring a new customer. New business involves working leads through a sales funnel, using marketing and sales budgets to gain additional customers. Existing customers will often have a higher volume of service consumption and can generate additional customer referrals.
